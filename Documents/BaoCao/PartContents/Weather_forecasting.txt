I. Short range weather forecast 

Forecasting of coming weather for 2 to 3 days in advance is called short range
weather forecasting. Weather phenomena for which forecast are issued under this type is:
• Rise and fall in temperature
• Speed and direction of wind
• Cloudiness
• Rainfall amount
 This type of weather forecast is issued by India Meteorological Department, Delhi for
different regions throughout the country. The error in forecast ranges from 20-30 per cent. 

II. Medium range forecast

 Forecasting of weather 4-10 days in advance is termed as medium range forecasting.
Presently, medium range weather forecasting for 4 days in advance is issued by National
Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting (NCMRWF) situated in NOIDA, U.P. This
forecast is issued twice in a week i.e. on Tuesday and Friday forecast error ranges from 30 to
40 per cent. Weather phenomena on which weather forecast is issued are as under:
• Increase or decrease in maximum and minimum temperature
• Cloudiness
• Speed and direction of wind
• Precipitation amount

III. Long range weather forecast

 Forecasting of coming weather for more than 10 days or a month or a season in
advance is called as long range weather forecasting. It may also be categorized as monthly
forecast or seasonal forecast depending on the lead time. Long range forecasting is issued by
India Meteorological Department, New Delhi for south west monsoon rains, first in April and
then the forecast is updated in July. This forecast is issued region wise i.e. country is divided
in four zones: (1) North eastern region (2) Central region (3) North Western Region (4)
Peninsular region. The forecast error varied around 40 per cent.
The weather parameters on which forecast have been issued as under:
• Onset of monsoon rains
• Deviation of rainfall amount from long period average (LPA) rainfall 

IV. Methods of weather forecasting
1. Synoptic method:
2. Analogue method:
3. Persistence method: 
4. Climatological Method:
5. Statistical methods: 
6. Numerical weather prediction methods: 

- Local symptoms show good weather:
    + Barometric increased non-stop, or less varied in the day.
    + The night sky is clear, many stars.
    + Morning in the sky appeared a lot of clouds Cumulus, cloud feet is flat, roofed arch, almost stand still.
    + Daytime, clouds cumulus increased, but grows vertically. Peak of cloud is not clear and develop strongly about 15-16 hours. In the afternoon, the clouds can be lowered, the clouds spread out, the clouds cumulus turn into layers cumulus and gradually dissipate.
    + Clouds ti are almost non-mobile and have no small hooks at the top, Cloud growth does not increase over time or develop in a certain direction.
    + Clouds ti-layer form a wide screen covering a portion of the sky with distinct edges. 
    + The daily variability of the temperature is evident. Daytime, the air temperature rises moderately. Nighttime, the temperature drops due to the ground having good radiation conditions.
    + In the hot season, there are many fogs in the evening, night fog and frost formed.
    + In coastal areas there is wind of sea - land, mountainous mountains with mountain wind - strong blowing valley is good weather symptoms.
    + In the morning, the dawn appears yellow, sometimes the dawn may begin with a light red, but then it becomes yellow, indicating that the sun's rays have relatively little vapor on the way.
- Local symptoms tell the rain:
    + Barometric decreases continuously.
    + Clouds-ti move fast and are like striped, parallel stripes. Clouds-ti move as fast as weather changes. Behind the cloud-ti appeared middle cloud, followed by dark cloud-dark layer.
    + The direction of clouds in the upper floors does not coincide with the downward direction of the wind.
    + At nighttime, the wind constantly blows and strengthens.
    + The sky at aurora, the sunset is bright red color without turning yellow, this phenomenon shows that the atmosphere contains more water.
    + As a result of the rays shining through the clouds-ti and ti-layers, around the sun and the moon form large circles called clouds.	
- Symptoms of localized thaw:
    + Barometric decreases fast.
    + Clouds cumulus appear, clouds rise rapidly, upper cloud clouds appear as a broom. From above, the cloud forms an anvil, peaking in the direction of the wind. Then there are thunderstorms, sometimes accompanied by hail.
    + High air temperature and humidity, stifling weather.
    + After thunderstorms occur, the weather usually becomes cool. If the weather is still mid-clouds and rosy clouds at sunset, the temperature does not drop, the night will continue to have thunder.
    +  When the thunderstorm approaches, the wind usually blows the direction of the thunderstorm and then changes direction.
