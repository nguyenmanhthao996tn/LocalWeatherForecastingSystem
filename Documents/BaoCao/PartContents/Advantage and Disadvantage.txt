Advantage
During the period of the thesis, we have received the enthusiastic support of our relatives, family, friends and especially thesis instructors. Besides, we also have received a lot of support from the Faculty of Computer Engineering, such as the equipment, research tools, working rooms and teachers in the department helped us in finding a lot of useful materials as well as solutions to complete the thesis. The University of Information Technology Facilities Management Department also helped a lot by permitting us to put environmental monitoring devices at the university campus. The collaboration between members of our team makes a significant contribution to the thesis success. We have a good plan for this thesis and a sense of responsibility. Also, the sharing of knowledge and experience of other research teams is also a resource for our team to complete this thesis.

Disadvantage
Besides the advantages mentioned above, the group has also encountered difficulties during the period of the thesis. Typically the lack of expertise in meteorology or knowledge we found is not exactly accurate. This affects the accuracy of forecasting results. Moreover, we need to collect environmental data and build environmental monitoring devices at the same time. For this reason, environmental data collecting was interrupted at some specific time, which lead to a lack of environmental data. Some sensors we use in this thesis are costly, rare and hard to find in the domestic market. Building forecasting application along with Web Servers on University's Linux VPS also faces many difficulties due to resource constraints and the need for network access permissions.
