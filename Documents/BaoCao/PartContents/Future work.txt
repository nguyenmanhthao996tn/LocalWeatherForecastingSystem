FUTURE WORK

Design node more compact, aesthetics and save more energy
Based on weather forecasting theory and experimental study, the dramatic decrease of pressure leads to rain in 4 hours after. However, to forecast rainfall in more than 4 hours in advanced, picture of the cloud is required.
Increase the number of environmental monitoring node to ensure that the data collected is exactly and enough
Develop the system into a network so that it can monitoring weather of a bigger region
Add OTA firmware update for Node and Gateway to improved usability and reduced costs of manual firmware upgrading
Add Ethernet connection to Gateway, ensure usability for users
Develop Self Hardware Failure Diagnostic system, improved hardware stability, especially environmental monitoring nodes when operating continuously outdoors and the system will notify when hardware has a problem
