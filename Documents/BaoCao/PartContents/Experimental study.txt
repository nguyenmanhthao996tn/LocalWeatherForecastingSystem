    2.2.1 Components in the system
        2.2.1.1 LoRa and LoRaWan
        LoRa, stands for Long Range Radio, is a wireless communication technology developed by Cycleo, and bought by Semtech in 2012. LoRa uses a modulation technique called Chirp Spread Spectrum. According to Semtech publication, this technique reduces the complication and accuracy requirement of receivers that need to achieve to decode data. In addition, LoRa does not require high transmit power to transmit to a receiver at a long distance cause the receiver can receive data even if received signal strength lower than ambient noise.  
        Working bandwidths of LoRa for regions of the world:
            868 MHz for Europe
            915 MHz for North America
            433 MHz band for Asia
        The technology is presented in two parts — Lora, the physical layer and LoRaWAN, the upper layers. LoRaWan is a protocol based on LoRa developed by LoRa Alliance. It's used in the industrial, scientific and medical (ISM) radio bands. A LoRaWan network structure usually is a star-of-stars model. Gateways are bridges forwarding messages between end nodes and server at the backend. Gateways connect to the internet via normal IP connections. Meanwhile, end nodes wirelessly single-hop connect to one or many gateways. A single LoRaWAN Gateway can cover up to 10Km. With the benefits of LoRaWAN's distance, The Things Network covers Amsterdam with just 10 gateways and costs $1200.
        
        2.2.1.2 MQTT
            MQTT was developed by IBM and Eurotech, the latest version is MQTT 3.1.1. MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) is a publish / subscribe protocol commonly used for Internet of Things devices with low bandwidth, high reliability and the ability to be used in unstable networks. It is based on a Broker, and is designed to be open and non-specific to any application, very simple and easy to integrate. MQTT is suitable for M2M (Mobile to Mobile) applications, WSN (Wireless Sensor Networks) or IoT (Internet of Things).
            There are 3 levels of QoS (Qualities of service) in MQTT:
                QoS 0 – Almost once: The broker/client sends the data once, only TCP/IP protocol confirm the successful receiving
                QoS 1 – At least once: The broker/client sends at least one successful receiving packet to the sender
                QoS 2 - Exactly once: The broker/client sends only one packet to the sender to confirm that the receiving process is successful
